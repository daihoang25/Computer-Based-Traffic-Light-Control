# Traffic Light Control System using PIC Microcontroller and C# Interface

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates the communication between a **PC (C# application)** and a **PIC16F887 microcontroller** for controlling and simulating a **traffic light system**.  

The system uses **UART serial communication** over virtual COM ports and controls LEDs through a **74HC595 shift register** and **7-segment displays**. The traffic light logic is simulated in **Proteus** and visualized in a **C# Windows Form application**.

## üö¶ System Architecture
1. **C# Form Application**  
   - Sends traffic light timing (4 steps) to the PIC via serial port.  
   - Receives state updates (`"RedA_GreenB"`, `"YellowA_RedB"`, etc.) from the PIC.  
   - Displays light status dynamically in the GUI.  

2. **PIC16F887 Microcontroller**  
   - Receives UART data, parses step timings, and controls LEDs/7-segment displays.  
   - Uses **74HC595** to expand outputs for LEDs.  
   - Sends feedback strings back to the PC.  

3. **Proteus Simulation**  
   - Emulates the circuit (PIC, 74HC595, LEDs, 7-segment).  
   - Verifies correct timing and light switching logic.
